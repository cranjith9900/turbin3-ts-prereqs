I think Solana mainly used TypeScript because itâ€™s easy to work with and runs everywhere JavaScript does.
It makes building dApps and connecting with wallets like Phantom smoother since most of the ecosystem is already in JS/TS.
Plus, the typing support helps avoid silly mistakes when dealing with accounts and transactions.
